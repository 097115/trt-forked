### Setting up mimeapp entry
- `trt` does not have the ability to read/add torrent files/magnet
  links(however, it can be added rather easily). This is because you don't
  really need this feature.

- Simply create a mimeapp entry, telling it what to do when it finds a torrent file/magnet link
```bash
# File: ~/.config/mimeapps.list
# xdg-open will use these settings to determine how to open filetypes.

[Default Applications]

# These .desktop entries can also be seen and changed in ~/.local/share/applications/
x-scheme-handler/magnet=torrent.desktop;
application/x-bittorrent=torrent.desktop;
```

- Now we must create torrent.desktop file under `~/.local/share/applications/`
```bash
# File: ~/.local/share/applications/torrent.desktop

[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Torrent
Exec=/usr/bin/env transadd %U
```

- `transadd` is a shell script in my `PATH`. This is the script that tells
  `transmission daemon` to add our torrent
```bash
#!/bin/sh

# Mimeapp script for adding torrent to transmission-daemon, but will also start
# the daemon first if not running.  transmission-daemon sometimes fails to take
# remote requests in its first moments, hence the sleep.

pidof transmission-daemon >/dev/null || transmission-daemon &
sleep 3
# notify-send "ðŸ”½ Adding Torrent"
exec transmission-remote -a "$@"
```
